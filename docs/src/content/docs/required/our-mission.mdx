The beginning of our collaborative journey in AI research

![Abstract art showing neural networks and human figures](/abstract_1.png)

## First Call

This first conversation is not an interview, it's a calibration. We want to understand what you're truly curious about. What questions you're obsessed with answering. What edge of science, engineering, or systems you can't stop thinking about. The collaborators you wish you could work with. The kinds of breakthroughs you believe are possible, but haven't yet seen. We want to understand what you'd build if you had the space, the team, and the right kind of pressure. The type of purpose you'd want to feel every day.

## What we are looking for

We're here to understand how you think, how you dream, and whether the way we approach the world resonates with what you're looking for next.

We're looking for people who still have fire for discovery. People who get energy from complexity and want to design their way into new capabilities, not just incrementally improve existing ones. We look for people who feel pulled toward the frontier, who have a strong internal compass, and who are excited to work in a fast-moving, high-trust, multidisciplinary environment.

## How it Works

There's no prep required. Just bring your questions and your raw perspective. This is a two-way conversation. We'll share more about Maincode, our mission, structure, and current direction, and we'll want to go deep on where you're coming from and what kind of work would be meaningful to you. We'll likely ask about what you're curious about right now, where you think the frontier is moving, what kinds of systems or research you'd love to pursue if you had the right conditions, and how you think about working with others in a setting where exploration and shipping go hand in hand.

## Why it Matters

Maincode is not a typical company. We're building something intentionally different, a space where smart, high-agency people can pursue the things they care most about, without having to trade curiosity for conformity.

This first call helps both of us get a clear signal on fit, not just in terms of direction, but in terms of working style, energy, and ambition. If it clicks, we'll show you the next step. We're excited to learn what drives you. Let's see where this goes.
