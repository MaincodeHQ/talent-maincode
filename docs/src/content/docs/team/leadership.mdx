Our team brings together diverse expertise in AI research, applied psychology, and design engineering. We're not just researchers—we're hands-on builders who remain deeply involved in both discovery and implementation.

## Our Team Philosophy

At Maincode, we believe the best breakthroughs happen at the intersection of disciplines. Our team is built on:
- **Cross-pollination** of ideas between research domains
- **Rapid prototyping** to test and validate theories
- **Deep collaboration** without traditional silos
- **Curiosity-driven** exploration with practical application

## Our Collaborative Process

##### Research Integration
We don't work in isolation—every project involves multiple team members bringing different perspectives:
- **Cross-disciplinary reviews** where psychology insights inform technical design
- **Rapid prototyping** to test theoretical concepts in practice
- **Regular research jams** where we explore new ideas together
- **Shared documentation** that captures insights across all disciplines

##### From Theory to Practice
Our research process is designed to maintain connection between discovery and application:
- **Applied constraints** inform theoretical research from day one
- **User feedback** shapes research priorities and directions
- **Iterative development** that cycles between research and implementation
- **Real-world testing** of research insights in practical applications

##### Knowledge Sharing
We believe in collective intelligence:
- **Weekly research seminars** where team members share their latest findings
- **Cross-training** so everyone understands adjacent disciplines
- **External presentations** at conferences and research gatherings
- **Open collaboration** with researchers at other institutions


##### Multidisciplinary by Design
We don't just bring different disciplines together—we integrate them:
- **Psychology-informed** AI architecture decisions
- **Design-driven** research priorities
- **Engineering-constrained** theoretical exploration
- **Human-centered** evaluation metrics

##### Speed and Agility
We move fast without sacrificing rigor:
- **Rapid hypothesis testing** through prototyping
- **Flexible research directions** that adapt to new findings
- **Direct implementation** of research insights
- **Short feedback loops** between theory and practice

##### Mission-Driven Focus
Everything we do serves our core mission:
- **Human reasoning** as the north star for all research
- **Practical application** as a constraint, not an afterthought
- **Collaborative intelligence** rather than replacement AI
- **Ethical considerations** built into every design decision
