Culture is how we collaborate, treat one another, and approach challenges. It’s shaped by every person who chooses to live our values in practice.

**Intentional**: We design our culture, not default to it  
**Inclusive**: Everyone contributes and belongs  
**Authentic**: No façades, we lead with who we really are  
**Evolving**: We learn, adapt, and refine together  
**Lived**: It’s visible in actions, not just words  

## How We Build Culture

**Retrospectives**: Honest lookbacks to improve how we work  
**Values Integration**: Hiring, feedback, and decisions reflect what we believe  
**Cultural Experiments**: We test new rituals, measure what works, and iterate


## Rituals & Practices

**Town Hall**: Weekly space to come together, to align, reflect, and celebrate  
**Coffee Chats**: Random pairings to strengthen cross-team trust  
**Show & Tells**: Learnings, demos, or personal passions  
**Culture Club**: Quarterly reflection on the state of our shared culture

## Living the Values

- **Excellence**: High standards for how we work and relate  
- **Integrity**: Transparent, respectful interactions  
- **Innovation**: We test, learn, and evolve cultural systems  
- **Empathy**: We meet difference with curiosity, not judgment  
- **Growth**: Culture is a vehicle for personal and team development
