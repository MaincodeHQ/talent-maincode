## Our Hiring Process

We've designed our hiring process to be respectful, transparent, and focused on finding the right mutual fit. Here's what to expect:

### Step 1: Application Review
**Timeline**: 3-5 business days

We'll review your application, including your resume, cover letter, and any portfolio work you've shared. We're looking for:
- Alignment with our values and mission
- Relevant technical skills and experience
- Evidence of continuous learning and growth

### Step 2: Initial Conversation
**Timeline**: 15 minutes via video call

If your application looks like a good fit, we'll schedule a brief conversation to:
- Learn more about your background and goals
- Share more details about the specific role and team
- Answer any questions you have about Maincode
- Determine if we should move forward in the process

### Step 3: Technical Assessment
**Timeline**: Varies by role (typically 2-4 hours)

This step varies depending on the role:

**For Engineering Roles**: 
- A take-home coding exercise that reflects real work

- Opportunity to showcase your coding style and thinking process

**For Non-Engineering Roles**:
- A practical exercise relevant to the role
- Opportunity to demonstrate your skills and approach
- Time to show how you think about problems and solutions

### Step 4: Team Interviews

- **Project collaboration** discussion with potential teammates
- **Values and culture** conversation with culture champions
- **Growth and development** discussion with leadership


### Step 6: Final Decision
**Timeline**: 2-3 business days

We'll make our final decision and extend an offer if we believe you're the right fit for the role and our team.

## What We're Looking For

### Technical Skills
We're looking for people with solid technical foundations, but we're more interested in:
- **Problem-solving ability** than memorization of specific technologies
- **Learning agility** rather than knowledge of every framework
- **Code quality** and maintainability over clever tricks
- **Collaboration skills** for working effectively in a team environment

### Cultural Fit
We're looking for people who:
- **Share our values** and want to contribute to our mission
- **Communicate effectively** in a remote-first environment
- **Embrace continuous learning** and growth
- **Collaborate well** with diverse teams
- **Take initiative** and ownership of their work

### Growth Potential
We're interested in people who:
- **Want to grow** professionally and personally
- **Are open to feedback** and coaching
- **Seek challenges** that push them outside their comfort zone
- **Contribute to others' growth** through mentorship and knowledge sharing

## Final Thoughts

Joining a new company is a big decision, and we want to make sure it's the right fit for both of us. We've created this detailed process because we believe that transparency and mutual understanding lead to better outcomes for everyone.

We're looking for people who are excited about our mission, aligned with our values, and ready to contribute to our culture. If that sounds like you, we'd love to hear from you.

Remember, this is a two-way evaluation. We want you to have all the information you need to make an informed decision about whether Maincode is the right place for your career growth and professional fulfillment.

We're excited about the possibility of working together and look forward to learning more about you and your goals.
